### Allow me to introduce myself (I hope you've had your coffee already)

---

Iâ€™m an undergraduate student in computer science at SÃ£o Paulo State University. As a curious dork, it's difficult to just focus on a single development stack - but I have worked with backend (.Net) and frontend (Angular).

I want to focus on my learning with some projects during my free time, hope you like them.

Farewell, guys!
